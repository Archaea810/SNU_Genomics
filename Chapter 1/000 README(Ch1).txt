This is a text file for bits and pieces missing from the textbook or some adjustments I have made for a more fluid experience.
- py2ri is obsolete. The new syntax is 'py2rpy' and vice versa.
- The 'assign' function must be used for the source code in the textbook to work while generating the yri-ceu scatter plot.


The material in this textbook lacks the proper 'editing' instructions for the images generated through the R's 'png' function.
This means that the png files generated are all automated in their resolution, font, and size.
Additional material is to be added in a later date that shows how to adjust the resolution, font size, and others using R.
