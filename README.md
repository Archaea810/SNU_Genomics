# SNU_Genomics
The genomics data (raw & processed) as well as some side projects during my time as an undergraduate researcher @ SNU

This includes some initial test runs of some well-known genome editing software, such as NGSQC, Velvet, etc...

'Cleandata_{n}' files contain the raw data for testing
'test_{x}' files contain the data that has been processed with {x} tool
'Protocols' contain the code for executing the tools in the SNU server

Some file names and protocols are subject to change with the continuation of my research
