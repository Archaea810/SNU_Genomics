# SNU_Genomics
The genomics data (raw & processed) as well as some side projects during my time as an undergraduate researcher @ SNU

This includes some initial test runs of some well-known genome editing software, such as NGSQC, Velvet, etc...

'Cleandata_{n}' files contain the raw data for testing
'test_{x}' files contain the data that has been processed with {x} tool
'Protocols' contain the code for executing the tools in the SNU server

Some file names and protocols are subject to change with the continuation of my research

For my works in BI Cookbook, some minor/major tweaks are made from the practices in the textbook.

Some include syntax fixes, others include supplementary material such as how to adjust the resolution and font size of an image.

For these programs to work properly, the following modules must be downloaded through 'pip' first:
- pandas
- rpy2
- Biopython

Furthermore, these packages must be downloaded through install.packages():
- ggplot2
- essentials
- gridExtra
- DataFrame
